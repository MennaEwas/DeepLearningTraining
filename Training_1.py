Theano
Keras is a wrapper library that hides theano completely, theano is
 efficient for numerical implementation

#convert it into a callable object

'''
introduction to tensorflow 
Nodes: data that moves bt nodes is called tensors which are multi-dimental
 arrays of real values
Edges: used for schynco 
operation: an operation is a named abstract computation which can take 
 input attributes and gave output attributes 
'''
#declearing two sambolic floating-point 
a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
b = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)

#create a simple sambolic expression 
add = tf.add(a, b)
#bind and evaluate 
sess = tf.Session()
binding = {a: 1.5, b:2.5}
c = sess.run(add, feed_dict= binding)
print(c) #4.0 
'''
Introduction to keras 
Keras: In a minimalist python library for deeplearning that can run on the top
of theano and tensorflow. It was developing to make models as fast and easy
for research and development. 

Steps for Keras 
1. Define your model --> Sequential  
2. compile your model --> compile()
3. fit your model --> fit()
4. Make prediction --> evaluate() and predict()
